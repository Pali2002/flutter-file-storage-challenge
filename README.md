## File Storage Flutter Challenge

File upload is becoming a more and more essential part of any application, where the user is able to upload their photo, their CV, or a video showcasing a project they are working on. The application should be able to fend off bogus and malicious files in a way to keep the application and the users safe.

In short, you will go through the following principles to reach a secure file upload implementation:

- List allowed extensions. Only allow safe and critical extensions for business functionality.
- Validate the file type, don't trust the Content-Type header as it can be spoofed.
- Change the filename to something generated by the application.
- Set a filename length limit. Restrict the allowed characters if possible.
- Set a file size limit.
- Ensure that any libraries used are securely configured and kept up to date.
- Protect the file upload from CSRF attacks.
